# Vue Single File Components Demo

A more complex example of how to use Vue single file components.

Every tutorial I found about single file components in Vue was trivial to the point of being barely useful, or it was cluttered with other webpack stuff. This simple Vue app shows a more complex example, but without the clutter.

Demonstrates how to use the following features:

* Props
* Sub components
* Some ways you could get data from a server-rendered page into your Vue app
* Using v-bind to pass data to a sub component
* Rendering sub-components in a loop with v-for and props
* Reactively setting data from outside the Vue app

The actual app is pretty trivial, but it shows the basic principles.

## Usage
It assumes a basic understanding of npm, webpack, Vue, and all that good stuff.

To use it:

1. Download or clone the app
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Run `npm install`. It should setup everything you need.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. Check it out in your browser!
